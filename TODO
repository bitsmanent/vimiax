Spare notes about things to do.

Note: most of the following items has been run off, so it's likely they are
incomplete or, sometimes, unanderstandable ;-)

Current release
===============

. I use dvorak as my default layout where vimiax works properly. Though, the
  '/' is handled as '&' when switch to qwerty.
. Yank the current url.
. Paste (goto) the yanked URL (p).
. U.reload() should resend POST data (e.g. refreshing submitted forms) like the
  builtin ^r command. Also it should works on view-source:// URLs too.
. Allow to view source into another tab.
. Exit with and without saving (ZZ and ZQ commands).
. Stop loading the current page (^c). This feature requires that the content
  scripts gets injected at "document_start" rather than _idle; this requires
  some code refactoring. Note: kernel.org and some other site do works properly
  with "document_start" but a lot of others doesn't works for some reason. This
  is the main (unique?) problem to solve.
. Auto-focus the currently found text, if it's a «clickable».
. HTML5 input system may need ^i (insert mode)
. Show a message when search is starting again from top/bottom.
. See all XXX comments into the code.


Further changes
===============
. Improves the web page.
. Add the '^c' command which stop loading.
. Restore "tab" to a new window if it was another instance of Chrome.
. It would be nice to have some filter which allows to parse text and get the
  relevant content which will be used in a number of ways like in the case of
  the bbcode links in forums, etc. We could maybe applies link hints to
  unlinked (no <a> tag) URI text...
. On Facebook link hints doesn't works as expected on "Older posts".
. Support for on-site search (e.g. Wikipedia, JQuery, Chrome API, etc.)
. ]] and [[ should open the link into another tab if CTRL is pressed on.
. Temporary data registry (D.reg in frontend.js) may be cleared up by just
  leaving reg: {}, in order to let routines add whatever needed field.
  Though it's needed to add empty objects like "modes", "reg", etc. Also,
  the "keys" object should be placed elsewhere.
  Currently routines must be adapted.
. Improve H.isvisible(). Consider to move it to U.
. Some element, (see Facebook "share" or "Language" selector) doesn't gets
  handled by the linkhints. It's likely some other sites won't works too. This
  may be an issue with increasing web2 pages. Not sure if it's fixable just via
  isvisible().
. Change the editor (E) to allow a call like E.parse(field, key), changing the
  field relatively to the input key. This made things more flexible and allow
  to easily attach the editor everywhere (see the next item).
. Handle editor in insert mode (input fields only or textarea too?)
. There should be a way to reverts the newtab/current tab flag for linkhints.
  Though, I'm still thinking about it since I'm not sure it's really needed.
. Pass-Through. Something like the following in D.reg would be enough:
	passthrough: false, /* true, false, 'nextonly' */
  I always use vimiax for my every day browsing without any needs for such
  feature. Not sure if it's needed at all.
  EDIT: well, it's obviously needed in case like the following:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/raycaster/RayCaster.html
. Extended-hints mode.
. New tabs should follow the process model, not just be independents. 
. Apply (bar) editor to the text field too.
. gf return back to the site if it's already enabled.
. Provide: o = entermode(D.modes.Insert).
. Add others shift-[0-9] characters to the S.keyfix list.
. Test it on MAC.
. Search while writing. document.body.find()???
. Use ^/ and ^? to start a search using last search text? This should simplify
  a bit the search routines and errors handling. Maybe refactoring it would be
  good.
. The prompt bar is weird on Shadowboxes.
. Zoom management conflicts with the builtin zoom system.
. Injects content scripts via T.scan().
. Notice when vimiax is not able to manage a page (suggests the user to report
  the page).
. Provide a more vim-like interface
. Find a way to remove the tabs bar (fullscreen? kiosk?)
. Configurable scrollbar toggling (still handle mouse scrolling)
. Handle meta key?
. It seems that if an inline overflow* is present, then the window.scroll*
  routines doesn't works at all. Use the frontend.js/fixpage() routine to
  workaround such pages.
. Session management (while waiting for the API support).
. Some keystroke should open the guide. So the next item borns spontaneous...
. Write the guide.
. Configuration file.
. Go to the url stored into the clipboard memory.
. ^i open current editable fields somewhere with a web-editor or so.
. Repeat the last search when the search string into the prompt is empty. It
  may be tricky since the prompt (editor) steal the focus to the page losting
  the chance of an incremental search.
. Add autocompletion support to the command line.
. Unify tabs informations. Well, I'll have to RTFM a bit but i think would be
  nice to mantains a set of shared informations between content script of
  various opened tabs. It would help in lots of way (e.g. share searches
  between tabs, etc.)
. Handle bookmarks.


Things to think about
=====================

. Add the "opts" argument to S.add(). Initially it should have two
  options: one to specify if the routine have to deal with the
  pre-keystrokes numbers itself or should be handled by the core (by
  calling repeat()); another which give hints about if the command
  should update the status bar or not.
. Add an onChange handler to the status bar which reset the timer and
  restart it in order to autohide the bar it's unused by StatusTimeout
  milliseconds.


Issues
======
Actually, the following issues can't be fixed:

. The extension doesn't work on https://chrome.google.com/extensions/*
  (nor in its view-source://)
. There is no toolbars API yet, so the only way is to use HTML bars.
. Tabs can't be hidden (despite kiosk mode and fullscreen).
. Extensions doesn't works in chrome:// pages.
. Clipboard handling (shift-ins) doesn't paste anything. To be check.


Problematic pages
=================
The following is a list of pages which behaves weirdly or just doesn't work in
some manner or another.

. http://forum.html.it/forum/showthread/t-1284667.html (link hints)
. http://ryan.rawswift.com/2009/02/15/fixed-that-bar-at-the-bottom-like-facebook/ (window.scroll*())
. Here the prompt of the status bar gets changed:
. http://filminstreaming.net/tag/cinema/ (prompt bar)
. http://www.dougmckenzie.nl/ (prompt bar)
. http://www.noiporno.com/ (link hints - unreadable)
. http://www.youporn.com/ (link hints - unhandled search field)
